       			       				As many of us that are able should find the time to pay our last respects to Niyi Esan. <br>

						I think I met the Esan brothers in Ilorin circa 1984/5 during the zonal qualifiers of one of the prevalent Scrabble competitions at that time (I can't recall the details). I was a cocky player who felt like the best in the country at that time. So I played this disabled guy called Dokun Esan and was beaten blue and black. It then dawned on me that there were many players scattered all over the country who had not been exposed to organised Scrabble that I was involved in as one of the pioneers. I had to regroup. My encounter with Niyi Esan yielded a more pleasant result. We hit off instantly though the junior Esan always tagged along🤣🤣 It's interesting that Niyi was older than us (Pally, Sammy, Debo Ajose etc) but had this way of relating with each and every one as mates. There's even a standing joke about Dokun, whom we refer to as aburo of our friend, despite being in fact older than most of us! 

						<br>While I was a State Counsel at the Ministry of Justice in Ibadan between 1985-89, Niyi stayed at a BQ close by. It was normal for me to go and play Scrabble with him at home during break which could last for 3hrs, go back to the office and close, then promptly return to play more Scrabble. Niyi was very accommodating. I recall a time I was transferred out of Ibadan and gave up my flat in Eleyele area.  When I was posted back to Ibadan in 1989, I squatted with Niyi till I left for Lagos in April 1990. I wasn't the only one. Sammy Okosagah also stayed in that flat of his. Next to Elders Adegbenro and Sanda's houses, Niyi always had an open house for all to play Scrabble.
						<br>As the saying goes, 20 boys cannot play for 20 years.  Work and family lives have impacted our interactions in recent years. Debo and Femi Champ are in UK,  Sammy is in the US,  Femi Fada is a corporate guru all over the place while I tend my little shop as a legal practitioner in Lagos. However, each time we meet, it was always a time to reflect on our youth and our hopes for the future. There was always something to reflect on. He was jocular, and didn't take issues too seriously. For Niyi, there was always a positive side to every situation, even when life did not deal a good card to him. He was a great guy always with positive vibes.

						<br>We never know when we'll leave this world. I never thought Niyi's situation was as bad, which is why his death is shocking. There was positivity in his last few posts on this forum and it was only yesterday that I got to know he was in such great pains while exuding positive vibes here. When we are beset with issues of physical health, one can never predict what the reaction will be. Niyi was in great physical distress. The pain, as I understand, was no longer bearable to him even as he was surrounded by loved ones. When the grim reaper came calling, the outcome was inevitable given his state of physical well being, or lack of it. 

							<br>Rest on Nayoo, my friend and my brother. I will miss you. We all will miss you. May the good Lord grant repose to your gentle soul. <strong>Amen.</strong>
